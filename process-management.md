## Process Management

Process management is an important task for Linux system administrators. Linux provides several tools for managing processes, including process monitoring tools and process control tools.

### Process Monitoring

Process monitoring is the process of monitoring running processes on a Linux system. Linux provides several tools for process monitoring, including `ps`, `top`, and `htop`.

#### `ps` Command

The `ps` command is used to display information about running processes on a Linux system. It provides a list of running processes, as well as information about their resource usage.

#### `top` Command

The `top` command is used to monitor system performance in real-time. It provides a list of running processes and their resource usage, as well as overall system statistics.

#### `htop` Command

The `htop` command is an enhanced version of the `top` command that provides a more user-friendly interface and additional functionality.

### Process Control

Process control is the process of managing running processes on a Linux system. Linux provides several tools for process control, including signals and process control commands.

#### Signals

Signals are a form of inter-process communication that can be used to control running processes on a Linux system. Some common signals include `SIGTERM`, which is used to terminate a process, and `SIGKILL`, which is used to forcefully terminate a process.

#### Process Control Commands

Linux provides several process control commands, including `kill`, `pkill`, and `killall`. These commands can be used to send signals to running processes and control their behavior.

### Process Prioritization

Process prioritization is the process of assigning priorities to running processes on a Linux system. Linux provides several tools for process prioritization, including `nice`, `renice`, and `ionice`.

#### `nice` Command

The `nice` command is used to assign a priority to a running process. A higher priority value means that the process is given more CPU time.

#### `renice` Command

The `renice` command is used to change the priority of a running process. It can be used to increase or decrease the priority of a process.

#### `ionice` Command

The `ionice` command is used to assign a priority to a running I/O process. A higher priority value means that the process is given more I/O time.

## Conclusion

In this section, we covered several tools and techniques for managing processes on a Linux system, including process monitoring tools, process control tools, and process prioritization tools. By mastering these tools and techniques, you will be able to monitor and control running processes on your Linux system efficiently and effectively.
